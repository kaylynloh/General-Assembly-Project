# General-Assembly-Project
Capstone Project for Python Programming Course

The project consists of the following:
1. Changes to median HDB resale flat prices from Jan 2017 to Jun 2021 and the top 5 towns with the most transactions using matplotlib,plotly and pandas.
2. Plotting previously transacted flats and the amenities within approximately 2km on the map based on user's input (town,room type, budget). This helps users to manage their expectations given their budget when looking for resale flat. Done using folium and pandas. 
3. Plotting HDB location and the amenites within approximately 2km on the map based on user's input (block no, town). This helps users to see the amenities near their chosen location. Done using folium and pandas.
